As of Milestone 3, our project is complete and according to the defined goals:

\begin{itemize}
    \item A topic was chosen and data sources were studied
    \item A data collection and processing pipeline was built through the use of a makefile
    \item An analysis of the documents was made, helping to better understand the data
    \item The documents were indexed in a search system and a schema for this step was provided
    \item Different types of queries, using features from the search system, were projected for each information need
    \item The information system's effectiveness was evaluated
    \item Improvements to the system were planned and executed
    \item A web application was created to utilize our system
    \item Evaluation of the improvements was made
\end{itemize}

Even though the improvements to our system did not have much success and the results performance of our system is not excellent, the group is very content with the work done and the results achieved.
